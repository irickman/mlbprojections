# MLB Batting Average Projections Script
This repo kicks off a job at 16:00 UTC every day that gathers the year-to-date hits, at-bats, and remaining schedule for every MLB player. The script outputs the data into a Google Sheet which feeds a Tableau Workbook that allows users to project an MLB player's batting average for the rest of the year.

The Tableau Workbook can be found [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ira.rickman/viz/MLBBattingAverageProjectionTool/PlayerProjectionTool)
